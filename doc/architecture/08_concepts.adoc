=== Event API structure

Event functionality is extracted in separate module. There are `event-service-xs2a-api` and `event-service-aspsp-api` services are presented.
Currently event module is a part of CMS and connects with XS2A using REST API. All events are stored to the database.

Event service is able to work without CMS. In this case event service is linked as maven dependency directly in XS2A.
