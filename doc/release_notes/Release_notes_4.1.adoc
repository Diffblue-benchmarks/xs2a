== Change yaml-generator to correct model Objects equals

From now on, instances of generated models in `xs2a-server-api` module will correctly compare superclass properties in `equals` method.

== Wrong PSU-ID can authorise endpoints

From now on, PSU that is different from the PSU in authorisation can not update data on the authorisation resource.
This applies to the following endpoints:

* consent `PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`,
* payment `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{payment-id}/authorisations/{authorisation-id}`,
* payment cancellation `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{payment-id}/cancellation-authorisations/{cancellation-id}`.
