== Bugfix: TPP domain validator ignores non-domain `tppName` field

From now on, if `tppName` is not a proper domain name, it will be ignored by XS2A in TPP domain validation. Before,
java `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown by the validator.

== Remove deprecated frequencyPerDay for PiisConsent

From now on, the deprecated field `frequencyPerDay` has been removed from `CreatePiisConsentRequest`,
`PiisConsentEntity`, and `PiisConsent`. The field has also been removed from the `piis_consent` table.
