* Bugfix: statuses of obsoleted AIS consents

== Bugfix: statuses of obsoleted AIS consents

Some changes were made in AIS consents statuses switching: obsoleted consents that were not confirmed with authorisation
now get status `REJECTED` (before it was `EXPIRED`).
When new AIS consent for account for one TPP and one PSU is created with reccuringIndicator=true, old authorised consents
get status `TERMINATED_BY_TPP`, but old unauthorised consents get status `REJECTED`.
