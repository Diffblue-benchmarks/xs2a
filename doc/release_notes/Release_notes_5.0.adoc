== Bugfix: TPP domain validator ignores non-domain `tppName` field

From now on, if `tppName` is not a proper domain name, it will be ignored by XS2A in TPP domain validation. Before,
java `IllegalArgumentException` was thrown by the validator.

== Remove deprecated frequencyPerDay for PiisConsent

From now on, the deprecated field `frequencyPerDay` has been removed from `CreatePiisConsentRequest`,
`PiisConsentEntity`, and `PiisConsent`. The field has also been removed from the `piis_consent` table.

== Bugfix: statuses of obsoleted AIS consents

Some changes were made in AIS consents statuses switching: obsoleted consents that were not confirmed with authorisation
now get status `REJECTED` (before it was `EXPIRED`).
When new AIS consent for account for one TPP and one PSU is created with reccuringIndicator=true, old authorised consents
get status `TERMINATED_BY_TPP`, but old unauthorised consents get status `REJECTED`. The same works for consents with `multilevelSca`
set to `true`: if old consents have `PARTIALLY_AUTHORISED` status - they obtain `REJECTED` status.
