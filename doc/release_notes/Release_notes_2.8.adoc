https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12086[Additional information about this issue]

== Bugfix: Wrong links in start authorisation response

From now on, all authorisation responses will contain `scaStatus` link instead of `self` and `status`.

== Bugfix: Balances link is not present in Read Transaction List with Balances

From now on, the endpoint for reading transaction list (POST `/v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/transactions?withBalance=true`) returns correct response with link `balances`.

== Bugfix: Ignore multilevel flag for one-off Consent on Account List of Available Accounts when SCA is not needed

When TPP sends `Create AIS Consent` request (`POST /v1/consents`) for one-off Consent on Account List of Available Accounts and for this request ASPSP
returns SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse with `multilevelScaRequired` parameter set to true, if in ASPSP Profile parameter `scaByOneTimeAvailableAccountsConsentRequired`
set to false, then `multilevelScaRequired` parameter will be ignored because SCA is not needed at all.

== Bugfix: Changed the allowed length for some HTTP headers

From now on, while sending HTTP requests to the XS2A the maximum length of `tpp-redirect-uri` and `tpp-nok-redirect-uri`
headers is extended to 255 symbols. Header `authorization` is not validated for length.

== Bugfix: Error on creating AIS consent with availableAccountsWithBalances attribute in the access property
From now on, TPP is able to create AIS consent with `availableAccountsWithBalances` attribute in the access property.
As a result, creation of AIS Consent with `allAccountsWithBalances` value in `availableAccounts` field is no longer allowed.

== Change String type of fields in Links to HrefType

From now on, object de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.domain.Links has new HrefType for all fields to simplify serialization to json.
