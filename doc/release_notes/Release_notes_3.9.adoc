== Log events to stdout
New event module `event-service-persist-log-impl` has been added with logging implementation of `event-service-persist-api`.
This module can be used in CMS instead of `event-service-persist-db-impl` in order to log events without saving them to the database.
All events are being written to a separate logger (`event-log`) at `INFO` logging level using `SLF4J`.

Additional configuration of `SLF4J`-compatible logging framework may be required in order to properly display event logs.
Default logging configuration provided in `cms-standalone-service` writes log records only to the console.
