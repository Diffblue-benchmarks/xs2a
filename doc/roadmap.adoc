= Roadmap

Starting 15th of March 2019 XS2A Team is providing development within two branches:

*Stable branch 2.x*

Stable branch will contain bugfixing and possibly necessary changes to support mandatory endpoints defined by Berlin Group NextGenPSD2 Spec 1.3

Stable branch 2.x will be supported till 01.09.2019 and will be replaced by the version 4.x

*Development branch 3.x*

Development branch is oriented on implementation of new features and optional endpoints.
No backward compatibility with 2.x is guaranteed. Since 01.09.2019 development branch 3.x will be continued with bugfixing in branch 4.x and new Development branch 5.x will be started.
