=== Configuring Payment types and Payment products

==== How to add new custom payment-product

Xs2a has implementation to support custom payment-products which are different from Berlin Group list.
To use for example "new-payment-product", open *bank-profile.yaml* and add it to *supportedPaymentTypeAndProductMatrix*:
```
  SINGLE:
   - new-payment-product
  PERIODIC:
   - new-payment-product
  BULK:
   - new-payment-product
```

Custom payment-products will be passed to SPI level through the interface *de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.service.CommonPaymentSpi*
Therefore this interface should be implemented in your SPI-Connector.
